For my project, I am thinking of something similar to the racer game. But maybe, one player against the computer. Haven't decided on that bit yet. And I want to put in random landmines throughout the course. I've also thought about scoreboards, timers, working reset button, and a player button that shows life left or some aspect like that.

<br>####### IDEAS:
-think about difficulty level or just one level of ease(?) OR OR OOORRR different amounts of time. 10sec 30sec 45 sec 
and maybe different sizes of grids
-Game: timer, reset
-Board: draw board out, gameOver
-Field: element, x, y, flagged, revealed
-both players go at same time/both want to reach finish
<br>#######Functionality:
-forcing both players to move forward with JS (setInterval(stuffToDo, seconds b/n))
-ok, i just fixed the alignment of my page. I'm starting on my characters...chose pacman to save time on sprites.
-added plain css
-got my characters in
-set timeout for start of game(setInterval kept re-starting and wouldn't shut up)
-aiming to assign keys to players now.
JS is stupid....or my head won't cooperate...jquery instead.
-fixed the players to move this morning.  Looks pretty good though.
-scrapped the mines. let's just move the pinky toe....get the players to stay on their damn field.
-added media queries...need to add to html as well.
-finally got the players to get to finish line and win. Now just to get the page to only alert for up button.
-Got an alert for a winner working.
-Changed up the css design of page to be more consistent and more aesthetically pleasing.
-remember to add in a link to the game page at the top of the readme.
-looking into multiple rounds for game.
-working on getting my timer to work...keeps re-setting...or getting the setInternval to bring up a timer. weird stuff going on.
<br>########## PHASE II
In the next phase, I would like to get the timer to stop resetting every time a button is pushed and also add in more rounds.
